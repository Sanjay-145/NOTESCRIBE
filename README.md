## NOTESCRIBE

In the realm of modern technology, harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) which are advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text, trained on vast datasets.
This project aims to leverage LLMs to address user queries efficiently by parsing PDF inputs.
 The three-page structure involves: 
1) Providing comprehensive answers to user-fed questions extracted from PDF documents.
2) Offering reference links for the code utilized in the project.
3) Crafting engaging blog posts and YouTube scripts to elucidate the underlying concepts and implementation methods. 
This initiative underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in enhancing information retrieval and knowledge dissemination.
